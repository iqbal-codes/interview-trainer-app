1. **Introduction**
The AI-Powered Interview Practice Platform is a web-based application designed to help job seekers prepare for interviews by simulating realistic interview scenarios using AI.

This tool aims to boost users' confidence and performance in real job interviews.

2. **Goals**

- To offer personalized interview questions based on user-defined roles, skills, experience, and specific job descriptions.
- To deliver constructive, AI-driven feedback and actionable insights to help users identify strengths and areas for improvement.
- To build user confidence and reduce interview anxiety.
- To create a scalable and accessible tool for job seekers at various career stages.

3. **Target Audience**
- Job Seekers: Individuals actively looking for new job opportunities across various industries and experience levels (entry-level, mid-career, senior).
- Students and Recent Graduates: Individuals preparing for internships or their first professional roles.
- Career Changers: Individuals transitioning to new fields or roles requiring interview preparation.
- Professionals Seeking Advancement: Individuals aiming for internal promotions or more senior positions who want to refine their interview skills.

4. **User Stories**
- As a job seeker, I want to create an account and set up my profile with my experience, skills, and target roles so that I can receive relevant interview practice.
- As a user, I want to be able to upload my CV/resume so the AI has better context about my background for generating questions and feedback.
- As a user, I want to generate a mock interview session by specifying the job role, necessary skills, interview type (e.g., behavioral, technical), and desired number of questions so I can practice for specific scenarios.
- As a user, I want to be able to paste a job description so the AI can generate highly relevant questions based on that specific role.
- As a user, I want to participate in a voice-based mock interview that feels like a real conversation so I can practice my verbal communication.
- As a user, I want to see a list of all my past interview sessions with their status and overall performance insights so I can track my progress.
- As a user, after completing an interview, I want to receive a detailed summary of my performance, including what I did well and specific areas I need to improve, along with actionable suggestions.
- As a user, I want the interview interface to be clear and easy to use, showing me the current question and who is speaking.
